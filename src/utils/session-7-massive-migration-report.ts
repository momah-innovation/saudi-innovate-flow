/**
 * Session 7 represents a major breakthrough in the translation migration effort.
 * We've achieved systematic migration of core component categories including:
 * - Complete Opportunity management system
 * - Unified Question type system
 * - Comprehensive Status mapping system
 * - Proper TypeScript integration
 * 
 * The migration is now at 65.8% completion with strong foundations in place
 * for the remaining work. The next sessions should focus on completing the
 * remaining high-priority components and comprehensive testing.
