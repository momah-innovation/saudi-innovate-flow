# ðŸ”§ Applied Fixes

## **Profile Completion Redirect Issue** âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: User with 80% profile completion was stuck on `/profile/setup` instead of being redirected to dashboard

**Root Cause**: ProfileSetup component had no logic to redirect users with complete profiles

**Fix Applied**: 
- Added profile completion check in ProfileSetup component
- Now redirects users with â‰¥80% completion to dashboard automatically
- Logs redirect action for debugging

## **Header Double Rendering/Translation Issues** âœ… FIXED 

**Problem**: Multiple "switch_language" translation warnings causing header rendering issues

**Root Cause**: Translation key fallback missing in header components

**Fix Applied**:
- Added fallback values for translation keys in UnifiedHeader
- Fixed duplicate translation calls in different header sections
- Now shows "Switch language" as fallback if translation key is missing

## **Storage Function Errors** âœ… TEMPORARILY DISABLED

**Problem**: All `get_bucket_stats` calls returning 400 errors with type mismatch

**Root Cause**: Database function has incorrect return type (numeric vs bigint)

**Fix Applied**:
- Temporarily disabled `get_bucket_stats` calls in useSystemHealth hook
- System health monitoring continues without storage stats
- Prevents console errors and failed network requests

## **Expected Results:**

1. âœ… **User with 80% profile completion will now redirect to dashboard**
2. âœ… **Header translation warnings eliminated** 
3. âœ… **Storage function errors no longer appear in network requests**
4. âœ… **App performance improved with reduced error noise**

## **Next Steps:**

- Fix the `get_bucket_stats` database function return type issue
- Re-enable storage statistics once function is corrected
- Monitor auth flow for both admin and regular users
