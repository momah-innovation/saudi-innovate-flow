## Current Implementation Focus

### üéØ Active Tasks (Next 2-3 days)
1. **Dashboard Integration** - Adding collaboration widget to UserDashboard
2. **IdeaDetailDialog Enhancement** - Embedding collaboration features
3. **Ideas Page Indicators** - Adding real-time collaboration status

### üìã Immediate Next Steps
1. Add collaboration widget to dashboard overview
2. Enhance IdeaDetailDialog with live document editing
3. Add presence indicators to idea cards
4. Implement challenge-specific collaboration spaces

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations
- All new integrations use existing CollaborationProvider context
- Real-time features leverage Supabase channels
- Components maintain backwards compatibility
- Progressive enhancement approach for collaboration features

### User Experience Guidelines
- Collaboration features are contextual and non-intrusive
- Clear visual indicators for collaboration status
- Seamless integration with existing workflows
- Mobile-friendly collaboration interfaces

### Performance Targets
- < 200ms collaboration widget load time
- Real-time updates within 500ms
- Minimal impact on existing page load times
- Efficient connection management

## Success Metrics

### Engagement Metrics (Target)
- 60% daily active collaboration users
- 5+ messages per user per day
- 80% collaboration feature adoption rate

### Performance Metrics (Target)
- 99.5% real-time connection uptime
- < 1% error rate in collaboration features
- < 3 second average response time

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Performance Impact** - Heavy real-time features affecting page load
2. **User Adoption** - Users not discovering collaboration features
3. **Technical Complexity** - Integration complexity across multiple pages

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Lazy Loading** - Load collaboration features on demand
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Introduce features gradually with tutorials
3. **Modular Architecture** - Isolated collaboration components for easier maintenance
