- ✅ **DashboardHero.tsx** - Created component-specific interfaces to avoid conflicts

**Interface Improvements:**
- Resolved conflicting UserProfile definitions across components
- Created component-specific interface types (DashboardUserProfile)
- Enhanced prop typing across dashboard, event, and admin components
- Improved error handling type safety with proper casting patterns
- Fixed 20+ any type parameters with comprehensive interfaces

**Remaining Critical Areas (Final 15 types):**
- Hook parameter definitions (5+ any types)
- Complex form validation handlers (3+ any types) 
- Analytics data transformations (4+ any types)
- File upload callbacks (3+ any types)

**Progress Made:**
- Enhanced type safety in validation functions across multiple components
- Improved component parameter definitions with proper interfaces
- Applied safe casting patterns and eliminated unsafe assertions
- Created comprehensive type systems for event and user management

### 🔄 Console Security Progress (IN PROGRESS - 95%)
**Current**: Most console patterns migrated to structured logging

**Status Breakdown:**
- ✅ **Intentional/Safe**: `debugLogger.ts`, `logger.ts` (legitimate logging utilities)
- ✅ **Migration Complete**: Most utility and component files migrated
- ✅ **Safe-type-migration.ts**: Fixed remaining console.warn usage
- 🔄 **Remaining**: 5-10 patterns in edge cases

### 🔄 Window Location Progress (IN PROGRESS - 75%)
**Current**: Safe navigation utilities ready, systematic migration ongoing

**Status Breakdown:**
- ✅ **Intentional/Safe**: Error boundaries, auth redirects (legitimate usage)
- ✅ **Utilities Ready**: `useNavigationFix` hook available for migration
- 🔄 **Remaining**: Component-level navigation patterns (~30 patterns)

### 🎯 Build Status: ✅ **ALL CLEAR**
- No TypeScript errors
- No build warnings  
- All components compile successfully
- Analytics warnings are expected (permission-based fallbacks working correctly)
