  - `useStorageOperations.ts` ✅ (15+ storage operations)
  - `useOpportunityOperations.ts` ✅ (12+ SQL queries)
  - `useProfileOperations.ts` ✅ (8+ SQL queries)
  - `useAnalyticsOperations.ts` ✅ (10+ analytics operations)
  - `useEvaluationOperations.ts` ✅ (15+ evaluation queries)

### ⚡ **Phase 2: Performance Optimization - COMPLETE**
- **7 Critical Components Optimized**:
  - `CampaignWizardOptimized.tsx` ✅ (18+ useState → 1 consolidated)
  - `EvaluationsManagement.tsx` ✅ (12+ useState → 1 consolidated)
  - `ProfileManager.tsx` ✅ (Using useProfileOperations)
  - `StorageManagementPage.tsx` ✅ (Using useStorageOperations)
  - `EditOpportunityDialog.tsx` ✅ (Using useOpportunityOperations)
  - `BulkFileActions.tsx` ✅ (Using useStorageOperations)
  - `ChallengeSettings.tsx` ✅ (Using useChallengeManagement)

### 🛠️ **Phase 3: Build Error Resolution - COMPLETE**
