## Statistics

- **Total Strings Fixed This Session:** 58
- **Components Completed:** 3
- **Translation Keys Added:** 0 (all existing keys were sufficient)
- **Cumulative Total Fixed:** 692+ strings across 34 components

## Key Observations

1. **Excellent Translation Coverage:** The opportunities.json file already had comprehensive translation keys for all the components fixed in this session. No new keys needed to be added.

2. **Consistent Pattern:** All three components followed the same pattern - they already had the necessary imports but weren't using the translation system consistently.

3. **Complex Components:** These were data-heavy analytics components with many metrics and labels, making them important for user experience.

## Technical Notes

- All components now properly use the `useUnifiedTranslation` hook
- No breaking changes introduced
- All components should compile without errors
- Maintained existing functionality while adding proper i18n support

## Next Steps

1. Continue with remaining Opportunities components:

   - AnalyticsImplementationStatus.tsx
   - AdvancedAnalytics.tsx
   - ApplicationsAnalytics.tsx
   - ApplicationsManagementDialog.tsx
   - BookmarkOpportunityButton.tsx
   - CreateOpportunityDialog.tsx

2. Move to Storage components (14+ files remaining)

3. Complete Statistics components (5 files remaining)

## Session Summary

Session 7 was highly productive, fixing 58 hardcoded strings across 3 complex analytics components in the Opportunities module. The existing translation infrastructure proved to be very comprehensive, requiring no new keys to be added. All fixes used existing translation keys from the opportunities namespace.

**Progress Status:** 68% of all components fixed (34/50+)
