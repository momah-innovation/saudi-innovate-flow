# Translation Fix Summary - Session 11

Date: January 20, 2025

## Components Fixed This Session

### Opportunities Components (3 components, 11 strings)

1. **OpportunityCommentsSection.tsx**

   - Status: Already properly using translations
   - No fixes needed

2. **CollaborativeOpportunityCard.tsx**

   - Fixed: 1 hardcoded string
   - Pattern: Hardcoded opportunity type translations
   - Solution: Used `t('opportunities:types.${type}')` for dynamic type translation

3. **OpportunityAnalyticsWidget.tsx**
   - Fixed: 10 hardcoded strings
   - Including: Views, Apps, Applications, Likes, Shares, Conversion Rate, Analytics title, View Details
   - Added analytics_widget namespace with 8 keys

## Translation Keys Added

### opportunities.json (EN/AR)

- Added `types.training` key
- Added complete `analytics_widget` namespace:
  - title
  - views
  - apps
  - applications
  - likes
  - shares
  - conversion_rate
  - view_details

## Summary Statistics

### This Session:

## Next Steps

Continue with remaining Opportunities components:
