# Analytics Migration Project

This document outlines the analytics migration project, which consolidated all metrics and analytics into a unified, RBAC-enabled system. It details the architecture, RBAC implementation, components, error handling, performance optimizations, testing, migration results, usage examples, security considerations, deployment, troubleshooting, and future enhancements.

## Architecture

### Analytics Service Layer
- **AnalyticsService**: Centralized services like `AnalyticsService`, `MetricsAnalyticsService`, and `ChallengeAnalyticsService`.
- **Database Functions**: Core functions like `get_analytics_data()`, `get_security_analytics()`, and `get_role_specific_analytics()`.
- **React Hooks**: Hooks for consuming analytics data, such as `useAnalytics`, `useMigratedDashboardStats`, etc.
- **Context & Providers**: `AnalyticsContext` for state management and `AnalyticsProvider` for app-wide tracking.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Defines permission levels: Basic, Advanced, Security, and Admin.
Illustrates RBAC implementation at database, component, and hook levels using code examples.

## Components and Migration Pattern

Lists migrated components, categorizing them into Critical, Real-time, and Error Handling components.
Shows a "Before vs After" code snippet demonstrating the migration pattern using `useAnalytics` hook.

## Error Handling and Performance

Details the error boundary strategy across different levels (component, service, database, network).
Describes fallback data structure and conditions for displaying "N/A".
Outlines caching strategies (service, database, component, browser) and an auto-refresh system.

## Testing, Results, and Usage

Covers test coverage areas (Unit, Integration, RBAC, Performance, E2E) and specific test files.
Summarizes migration results, including component and service completion percentages.
Provides usage examples for basic, admin, and real-time analytics.

## Security, Deployment, Troubleshooting, and Future

Discusses security considerations like data protection (RLS, function security) and privacy compliance.
Details environment variables and database migration deployment.
Lists common troubleshooting issues and debugging tools.
Outlines future enhancements such as real-time WebSocket updates and advanced visualizations.
