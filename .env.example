# Supabase Configuration
# ================================
# Get these values from your Supabase project dashboard:
# 1. Go to https://app.supabase.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/settings/api
# 2. Copy your Project URL and anon public key

# Project URL (replace YOUR_PROJECT_REF with your actual project reference)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co

# Anon/Public Key (safe to expose in browser)
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_ANON_KEY

# Server-side Configuration (for Node.js scripts and edge functions)
# ================================
# These are for server-side operations and should NEVER be exposed to browsers

SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_ANON_KEY

# Service Role Key (KEEP SECRET - has admin privileges)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

# Security Guidelines
# ================================
# - Never commit .env files to version control
# - Use different keys for development vs production
# - Service role key should only be used server-side
# - Regularly rotate your keys if compromised
# - Set up proper authentication URL configuration in Supabase dashboard

# ================================
# For production deployment, set these environment variables in your hosting platform:
# - Vercel: Project Settings > Environment Variables
# - Netlify: Site Settings > Environment Variables  
# - Railway: Project > Variables
# - Heroku: App Settings > Config Vars
